// From W3C: "A nav element doesnâ€™t have to contain a list, it can contain other kinds of content as well", so does not expilicitly need a <ul> nested within it
// "Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate" http://w3c.github.io/html/sections.html#the-nav-element
// Think Table of Contents, Previous/next buttons, Search form, Breadcrumbs
nav {
    a {}
    [role="search"] {
        //This would be your search form, appropriately placed within the <nav> element
    }
}
